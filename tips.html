                <h3 class="card7H">1. Handling Vinyl</h3>
                <p>Much like how people will panic if you touch the data side of the CD the same applies to vinyl. When you touch the playing surface you’ll transfer oils from your skin into the grooves, which dust will stick to and affect the sound quality. You also run the risk of scratching the grooves with your fingernails.</p>

              <div class="cardtext7-2">
                  <h3 class="card7H">2. Outer sleeves</h3>
                  <p>An outer sleeve is a thin, plastic casing that slips over the entire record, jacket and all. Use these while storing your records to ensure your freshly cleaned or newly purchased vinyls don’t get dusty in between spins.</p>

                <h3 class="card8H">3. Professional calibration</h3>
                <p>This is more so for people who are serious about their collection but, there are professional audio engineers that will calibrate your turntable to ensure it’s producing the best output. This can be anything from calibrating the tonearm’s position or adjusting the vinyl record speed. Be warned, these calibrations aren’t cheap, but any audiophile will tell you the sound is unbeatable.</p>

                <h3 class="card9H">4. Buying used</h3>
              <p>There is a universally accepted vinyl-grading system that is used to determine the conditions of a used record.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="cardtext9-2">
            <p> <span class="boldtxt">(P) or Fair (F):</span> Pretty self-explanatory — this is a record in bad condition and usually has scratches, skips, warps in the vinyl that are often audible, noise, and other imperfections. Unless it’s in a dollar bin, take a pass on this vinyl. 
                <br>
                <br>

                <span class="boldtxt">Good (G) or Good+ (G+):</span> Not quite as straightforward as it sounds, a G grading doesn’t always mean good. Discogs describe this rating as a record that can be played without skipping but could have scratches, surface noise, or visible groove wear. The sleeve is likely split, cracked, or held together with tape.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                    <span class="boldtxt">Very Good (VG):</span> It’s common for VG-graded records to have some surface noise, groove wear, and light scratches that will be audible when played, but usually only during softer parts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                
                        <span class="boldtxt">Very Good+ (VG+):</span> Usually taken good care of by their previous owners, a VG+ record could have some light wear and surface defects that are usually inaudible. Unless it’s a rare record at a good price that you must have, VG+ should be the baseline that you strive for with used records.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                
                            <span class="boldtxt">Near Mint (NM or M-):</span> This is basically any record other than a new one that has likely never been played or only been played a handful of times and will play perfectly. It should have no signs of wear, and its packaging should be untouched.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                <span class="boldtxt">Mint (M):</span> These are perfect vinyls, having either never been played or potentially even still factory sealed. Used record retailers rarely label their records with the Mint grading.
